BrewChat: Enhancing Interview Preparation
Inspiration
During a discussion about co-ops and the interview process, we realized the significant impact of coffee chats. These informal conversations often help candidates prepare better for formal interviews, providing insights and boosting confidence. This inspired us to create brewchat, a tool designed to capture the essence of these chats and make interview preparation more effective.

What It Does
brewchat allows users to record their coffee chat interviews, automatically transcribes these conversations into summaries, and provides tailored follow-up questions. Users can store multiple chat sessions and review them anytime to refine their approach and boost their confidence.

How We Built It
Conceptualization: Defined key features like recording, transcription, follow-up questions, and chat storage.
Development: Used modern web development technologies to build the platform, incorporating a microphone feature, automatic transcription, and a user-friendly interface.
Testing: Conducted rigorous testing to ensure accuracy of transcriptions and relevance of follow-up questions.
Challenges We Ran Into
Accuracy of Transcription: Ensuring accurate and useful transcriptions required fine-tuning our algorithms to handle various accents and speech patterns.
User Interface Design: Creating an intuitive and seamless user interface that accommodated all features without overwhelming the user required several iterations.
Data Storage: Efficiently storing and retrieving multiple chat sessions while maintaining data privacy and security was a critical aspect we had to address.
Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Successfully developed a platform that makes interview preparation more efficient and impactful.
Created accurate transcription algorithms that work with various accents and speech patterns.
Designed an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
What We Learned
We learned the importance of detailed review and continuous improvement in interview preparation. We discovered that having access to past conversations, being able to revisit them, and receiving tailored follow-up questions can significantly enhance an interviewee's readiness and confidence.

What's Next for BrewChat
We plan to enhance brewchat by adding more advanced features, such as AI-driven feedback on interview performance, integration with calendar apps for scheduling interviews, and expanding our transcription capabilities to support multiple languages. We aim to make brewchat an indispensable tool for anyone preparing for interviews.
